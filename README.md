# GraphQL Apollo Server Setup with Prisma and SQLite

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed (v12 or later recommended).
- npm or yarn package manager.
- SQLite3 (for the database).

## 1. Initialize a New Node.js Project

```bash
mkdir graphql-server-prisma
cd graphql-server-prisma
npm init -y
```

## 2. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary packages for your GraphQL server:

```bash
npm install @prisma/client@^5.2.0 apollo-server@^3.12.1 graphql@^16.8.0 prisma@^5.2.0
```

## 3. Set Up Prisma

- Initialize Prisma in your project:

  ```bash
  npx prisma init
  ```

- Replace the `schema.prisma` file with the following content to match your schema:

  ```prisma
  [Replace this section with your schema content]
  ```

## 4. Generate Prisma Client

Generate the Prisma Client based on your schema:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

## 5. Create the Apollo Server

Create an `index.js` file for your Apollo Server:

```javascript
[Insert the JavaScript code provided in the previous response here]
```

## 6. Start the Server

Run your Apollo Server:

```bash
node index.js
```

Your GraphQL server should now be running at the URL specified in the console.

## 7. Test Your GraphQL API

You can use a tool like GraphQL Playground or Apollo Studio to test your GraphQL API by navigating to the server's URL in a web browser.

That's it! You now have a GraphQL Apollo Server set up with Prisma and SQLite3 using the given database schema. You can create, query, and manipulate data using GraphQL queries and mutations based on your schema.
